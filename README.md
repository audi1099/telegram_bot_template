# Telegram Bot Template

This repository provides a template for creating a Telegram bot using Python. Follow the instructions below to set up and run your bot.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download or Clone the Repository

You can either clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram_bot_template.git
   cd telegram_bot_template
OR

Download the ZIP file:
Download the ZIP file from the provided link.
Extract the ZIP file to your desired directory.
Navigate to the extracted folder.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip. Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 3: Configure the Bot
Rename the configuration file:

Rename config_example.py to config.py.
This file contains placeholders for your API tokens.
Edit the configuration file:

Open config.py in your preferred text editor.
Replace the placeholders with your actual API tokens:
API_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN'
WEATHER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY'
NEWS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY'
Save the file after making the changes.

### Step 4: Initialize the Database (Optional)
If you plan to use the SQLite database to store user data:

The template will automatically create the SQLite database file (bot_database.db) and the necessary tables when you first run the bot.
If needed, customize the database schema in the bot.py file.

### Step 5: Run the Bot
In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and start the bot:
python bot.py
The bot will begin polling for messages. You should see log output indicating the bot is active.

### Step 6: Test the Bot
Open Telegram and find your bot. You should have created it using BotFather and received your API token.
Send the /start command to your bot.
Test other available commands like /help, /weather, /news, and /rate.
Troubleshooting
Missing Packages: If packages are missing, ensure they are installed by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
API Tokens: Double-check that you have correctly entered your API tokens in config.py.
Python Version: Ensure your Python version is 3.7 or higher.
Customization
You can expand the bot's functionality by adding new commands or integrating additional APIs. The bot uses the aiogram library, making it flexible and easy to customize. For more details, refer to the aiogram documentation.
